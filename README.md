# Your to-do list

Everything that needs to be done to launch your Project is broken down into tasks in the Asana to-do list below:

https://app.asana.com/0/789544874807947/789544874807947

The red tasks are for instructors and the blue tasks are for your DataCamp contact. Your DataCamp contact will assign due dates throughout the creation process for your Project. All you need to do is report your progress on each task by clicking the checkbox on its left-hand side when complete. Asana training shouldn't be necessary, but here is an Asana [quick start guide](https://asana.com/guide/get-started/begin/quick-start) guide just in case.

# Things to install

There are some packages you need to be able to create DataCamp Projects locally. Run the following commands in a terminal to install them.

*You might need to change pip into pip3 depending on how you installed python.*

```
pip install nose
pip install git+https://github.com/datacamp/ipython_nose
```
